# Milo Moisson's project ideas

---

-   **Notion Bookmark DB** in **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**

    > A browser extension that allows you to bookmark pages on Notion in a DB. (More configurable than the official extension, custom properties, etc.)

-   **label-logger** in **[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)**

    > A Cargo-like logging library with terminal configuration.

-   **git-cmz** in **[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)**

    > A cli tool that allow you to follow conventional commits convention bug-free. Use with `git cmz | git commit -F -` (build the message and then pass it to git via stdin)
